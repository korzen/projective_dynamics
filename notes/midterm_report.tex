\section{Current Status}

We've currently got an implementation the Fast Simulation of Mass-Spring Systems paper, which
from our understanding is somewhat a subset of Projective Dynamics, in that it just handles
projecting/solving spring constraints. This solver supports a CUDA backend where the local
and global steps are performed on the GPU however the global step is currently solved with
a Conjugate Gradient solver since we've integrated with ViennaCL which doesn't provide
sparse direct solvers.

\section{Remaining Work}

We need to implement the full projective dynamics solver, about which we still have many open
questions.
