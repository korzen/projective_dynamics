\section{Introduction}
Projective Dynamics~\cite{Bouaziz14} solves continuum mechanics system using
local projective step and global implicit solver step. The local step projects
to constraints to valid state and has no interdata dependencies, thus is data
parallel. The global step solves a system on linear equations which represent
the projections and external forces (including inertia). We choose to explore
parallelization of global step, the local step is trivial, by implementing
a special case of projective dynamics for mass-spring system~\cite{Liu13}


\section{GPU}

The state-of-the art iterative solver seems to be~\cite{Wang15}.



\section{CPU}


\section{Conclusion}
During this project we have explored direct and iterative solvers on GPU,
simple domain decompositions, and parallel block Jacobi solver on CPU.
